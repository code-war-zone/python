## 🎯 **Learning Objectives — What You Will Master**

By the end of this course, you will have a complete, professional-level understanding of Python development,
including real-world skills used in the industry.

---

### 🧱 **Core Python Fundamentals**

* Understand Python's syntax, execution model, and dynamic typing system.
* Write clean, readable, maintainable Python code using PEP 8 standards.
* Master variables, operators, expressions, and built-in functions.

---

### 🧰 **Data Structures & Algorithms**

* Work fluently with lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and nested collections.
* Use slicing, comprehensions, and efficient data manipulation techniques.
* Understand Big-O basics, common algorithms, and practical problem-solving.

---

### 🔁 **Control Flow & Program Logic**

* Use conditional logic to make decisions (`if/elif/else`).
* Write efficient loops (`for`, `while`) with `break`, `continue`, and `else` clauses.
* Apply iteration patterns and loop optimizations.

---

### 🧩 **Functions, Recursion & Functional Programming**

* Create reusable functions with parameters, return values, and annotations.
* Work with `*args`, `**kwargs`, default parameters, and keyword-only arguments.
* Use decorators, closures, recursion, lambda expressions, and higher-order functions.
* Apply functional tools like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `functools`, and `itertools`.

---

### 🏗 **Object-Oriented Programming & Design Principles**

* Build classes, objects, constructors, inheritance hierarchies, and composition.
* Understand encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and magic methods.
* Apply OOP design principles such as DRY, SOLID, and clean architecture.
* Use abstract classes, interfaces (Protocols), and dataclasses.

---

### 📦 **Modules, Packages & Dependency Management**

* Organize large codebases using modules and package architectures.
* Use `pip`, `requirements.txt`, and virtual environments.
* Create your own installable Python package.
* Understand namespacing, imports, and Python's module resolution system.

---

### 📂 **File Handling, Serialization & OS Automation**

* Read and write text, binary, and structured files.
* Work with JSON, CSV, XML, and custom serialization.
* Use `os`, `shutil`, `pathlib`, and environment variables.
* Build automation scripts for file systems, backups, and reports.

---

### 🐞 **Error Handling, Debugging & Logging**

* Write safe, predictable programs using `try/except/finally`.
* Create custom exception classes.
* Use the Python debugger (`pdb`, VS Code debugger).
* Implement professional logging using the `logging` module.
* Understand Python memory model, garbage collection, and object lifecycle.

---

### 🗄 **Databases & SQL**

* Work with SQLite and PostgreSQL directly from Python.
* Perform CRUD operations, joins, relationships, and indexing.
* Understand SQL schemas, normalization, and transactions.
* Use SQLAlchemy ORM for professional database modeling.

---

### 🌐 **APIs, Networking & Backend Development**

* Consume REST APIs using `requests` and `httpx`.
* Understand HTTP verbs, status codes, authentication, and JSON parsing.
* Build a complete FastAPI backend with:

  * routing
  * request/response models
  * validation with Pydantic
  * middleware & dependency injection
  * database integration
* Implement async endpoints and background tasks.

---

### ⚙️ **Testing, Automation & Software Engineering Best Practices**

* Write unit tests, integration tests, and mocks using `pytest` and `unittest`.
* Automate workflows, data pipelines, and repetitive tasks.
* Implement continuous integration basics (GitHub Actions optional).
* Use type checking (`typing`, `mypy`), linters, and formatters.
* Build CLI tools with `argparse` and `click`.

---

### 🚀 **Concurrency, Parallelism & Performance**

* Understand Python's concurrency models:

  * threads
  * multiprocessing
  * async/await
* Use `asyncio`, executors, and parallel processing for performance.
* Profile and optimize slow Python programs.

---

### 📈 **Bonus: Data Manipulation, Visualization & Scientific Tools**

(If you choose to include these in your course)

* Intro to NumPy, Pandas, and data analysis workflows.
* Plotting data with Matplotlib or Seaborn.
* Basics of Jupyter Notebooks.

---

### 📦 **Packaging, Distribution & Deployment**

* Create distributable packages using `setuptools` or Poetry.
* Versioning, changelogs, semantic release.
* Deploy FastAPI apps using Docker, Uvicorn, and cloud platforms (optional).

---

### 🚀 **Real-World Capstone Projects**

Throughout Week 12, you will build **production-grade applications**, such as:

* A full CRUD API with FastAPI + PostgreSQL
* A CLI automation toolkit
* A data analysis pipeline
* A personal finance manager
* A REST client + scraping system
* A multithreaded downloader or async task manager

Your capstone will be polished, documented, and ready for your portfolio.

---

## 📚 **Prerequisites**

This course assumes:

### Required

* No prior programming experience (complete beginner-friendly)
* Ability to install software (Python, editor, tools)
* Basic computer literacy

### Optional but Helpful

* Some exposure to the command line
* High-school level math reasoning
* Curiosity, creativity, and willingness to build things
