## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this 12-week course, you will confidently be able to:

### 🧱 **Core Python Fundamentals**

* Understand Python syntax, semantics, and execution flow.
* Use variables, operators, expressions, and built-in functions.

### 🧰 **Data Structures & Algorithms**

* Work fluently with lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, and nested structures.
* Apply algorithms such as searching, sorting, and data manipulation.

### 🔁 **Control Flow**

* Write programs using conditional logic (`if/elif/else`).
* Use loops efficiently (`for`, `while`) with control statements.

### 🧩 **Functions & Functional Programming**

* Create reusable functions with parameters and return values.
* Use advanced concepts like `*args`, `**kwargs`, decorators, lambdas, map/filter/reduce.

### 🏗 **Object-Oriented Programming**

* Build classes and objects.
* Apply encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and magic methods.

### 📦 **Modules, Packages & Environments**

* Structure large projects using modules and packages.
* Use `pip` and manage dependencies with virtual environments.

### 📂 **Files, JSON, CSV, & OS Automation**

* Read/write files, parse JSON, handle CSV data.
* Use `os` and `pathlib` for filesystem automation.

### 🐞 **Exception Handling & Debugging**

* Identify and manage runtime errors with `try/except`.
* Use debugging tools and logging for reliable applications.

### 🗄 **Databases & SQL**

* Use SQLite and PostgreSQL with Python.
* Perform CRUD operations, joins, and schema design.

### 🌐 **APIs & Backend Development**

* Consume external APIs using `requests`.
* Build your own REST APIs using FastAPI and Pydantic.

### 🧪 **Testing & Automation**

* Write automated tests using `pytest` or `unittest`.
* Automate real-world tasks (file management, scraping, scripts).

### 🚀 **Real-World Projects**

* Build complete applications combining Python, databases, and APIs.
* Produce portfolio-ready projects demonstrating practical skills.
